Cricket, the second most popular sport in the world, has gone through many changes in the new millennium. The biggest and most influential change may arguably be the addition of Twenty Twenty cricket, known as T20 cricket. To give a brief background cricket has 3 different formats in which the sport is played consisting of Test Cricket(the oldest form of the game and lasts for 5 days), One Day Cricket which is played for roughly 8 hours and T20 Cricket which is played for about 3 to 4 hours. For most of Cricket’s history, runs have been scored with patience and without risk until T20 came along.  My goal in this post is to see if the Introduction of T20 cricket, which was introduced in 2003 and is a much more fast paced and aggressive form of the game, had any effect on the quantity of runs scored in One Day International(ODI) Cricket which was introduced in 1971.
	I looked at the amount of ODI matches In which at least one team scored more than 300 runs and decided to compare how many there were before T20 started in 2003 and how many there were after. The result was that over 75% of these scores occurred after 2003 compared to before. This means that more than 3/4 of these high scoring matches occurred in a time frame that is less than ½ of ODI cricket’s history.
	I decided to give a more focused look at the statistics from the most popular tournament in Cricket which is the ODI World Cup. I looked at the average amount of boundaries scored, the average strike rate of batsman and the total amount of runs scored in world cup matches. The 3 plots seem to show that these stats have steadily increased since 2003.
	I also took the overall average of these stats from before 2003 and after 2003 and compared them.
	This shows that there is a significant increase in these numbers after 2003.

With the Information in hand I conclude that there is some correlation between T20 Cricket and the increased rate of run scoring in Odi Cricket.
