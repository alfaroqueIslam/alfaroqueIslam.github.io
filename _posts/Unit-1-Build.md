Cricket, the second most popular sport in the world, has gone through many changes in the new millennium. The biggest and most influential change may arguably be the addition of Twenty Twenty cricket, known as T20 cricket. To give a brief background cricket has 3 different formats in which the sport is played consisting of Test Cricket(the oldest form of the game and lasts for 5 days), One Day Cricket which is played for roughly 8 hours and T20 Cricket which is played for about 3 to 4 hours. For most of Cricketâ€™s history, runs have been scored with patience and without risk until T20 came along.  My goal in this post is to see if the Introduction of T20 cricket, which was introduced in 2003 and is a much more fast paced and aggressive form of the game, had any effect on the quantity of runs scored in One Day International(ODI) Cricket which was introduced in 1971.
